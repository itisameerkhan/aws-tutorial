An EC2 instance (Elastic Compute Cloud instance) in AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a virtual server that you can use to run applications on the AWS cloud infrastructure. EC2 instances provide resizable compute capacity, making it easier to scale up or down based on your needs.

## EC2 

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent virtual servers, known as instances, to run applications in the cloud. EC2 offers a range of instance types with varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity, allowing users to choose the most appropriate instance type for their needs.

Suppose instead of taking AWS EC2, we consider taking a dedicated set of servers, so, what all we might have to face:

* Now for using these servers, we have to hire an IT team which can handle them.

* Also, having a fault in the system is unavoidable, therefore we have to bear the cost of getting it fixed, and if you don‚Äôt want to compromise on your up-time you have to keep your systems redundant to other servers, which might become more expensive.

* Your own purchased assets will depreciate over the period of time, however, as a matter of fact, the cost of an instance have dropped more than 50% over a 3-year period, while improving processor type and speed. So eventually, moving to Cloud is all more suggested.

* For scaling up we have to add more servers, and if your application is new and you experience sudden traffic, scaling up that quickly might become a problem.

## ‚ö° Instance

An EC2 instance in AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a virtual server that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It allows users to run applications on virtual machines with customizable configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking resources. 

## ‚ö° Resizable

They are re-sizable because you can quickly scale up or scale down the number of server instances you are using if your computing requirements change.

## ‚ö° Burstable Performance of T2/T3 Instances 

Amazon EC2 T2 and T3 instances are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the capability to burst above the baseline when needed. This burstable performance model is particularly suitable for workloads that don't require constant high CPU performance but may need occasional bursts of higher performance.

T2 instances are burstable instances, meaning the CPU performs at a baseline, say 20% of its capability. When your application needs more than 20% of the performance of the CPU, the CPU enters into a burst mode giving the higher performance for a limited amount of time, therefore work happens faster.

### ‚≠ê Burstable CPU Credits

* **Accrual of Credits**: When an instance is running below its baseline, it earns CPU credits. Each credit provides the performance of a full CPU core for one minute.

* **Spending Credits**: When an instance needs to perform tasks that require more CPU than the baseline provides, it spends its accumulated credits to increase its CPU performance up to 100% of a single core.

* **Credit Balances**: The instances have a maximum credit balance they can accrue. For example, a t3.micro instance can accumulate up to 144 CPU credits.

* **T2 Unlimited**: In Unlimited Mode, if the instance needs more CPU credits than it has, it can continue to burst above the baseline by borrowing credits. If the instance‚Äôs average CPU utilization over a 24-hour period exceeds its baseline, charges may apply.


## ‚ö° Key Pair

Amazon EC2 uses public‚Äìkey cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. Public‚Äìkey cryptography uses a public key to encrypt a piece of data, such as a password, then the recipient uses the private key to decrypt the data. The public and private keys are known as a key pair.

## ‚ö° Elastic Load Balancing

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is a service provided by AWS that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones (AZs). It helps ensure that the application is highly available, fault-tolerant, and scalable.

## ‚ö° Elastic IP Address

Elastic IP Addresses are static, public IPv4 addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. They are associated with your AWS account and can be used to mask the failure of an instance or software by remapping the address to another instance within the same region.

## ‚≠ê CPU CREDITS

AWS EC2 has 2 different type of instances: Fixed Performance Instances(e.g. M3, C3 etc) and Burstable Performance Instances (e.g. T2). Fixed Performance Instances provides a consistent CPU performance whereas Burstable Performance Instances provide a baseline CPU performance under normal workload. But when the workload increases Burstable Performance Instances have the ability to burst, i.e. increase the CPU performance.

CPU Credit regulates the amount CPU burst of an instance. You can spend this CPU Credit to increase the CPU performance during the Burst period. Suppose you are operating the instance at 100% of CPU performance for 5 minutes, you will spend 5(i.e. 5*1.0) CPU Credit. Similarly if you run an instance at 50% CPU performance for 5 minutes you will spend 2.5(i.e. 5*0.5) CPU Credits.

CPU Credit Balance is simply the amount of CPU Credit available in your account at any moment.

When you create an instance you will get an initial CPU Credit. In every hour you will get certain amount of CPU credits automatically(this amount depends on the type of instance). If you don't burst the CPU performance the CPU Credit will be added to your CPU Credit Balance of your account. If you are out of CPU Credit(i.e. CPU Credit Balance turns into 0) your instance will work on baseline performance.

## ‚≠ê Purchasing Options

Amazon EC2 offers several purchasing options to provide flexibility and cost management for different use cases. Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation of the purchasing options available:

### 1. **On-Demand Instances**
- **Description**: On-Demand Instances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second, with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. This option provides the highest level of flexibility.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.

### 2. **Reserved Instances (RIs)**
- **Description**: Reserved Instances provide a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand pricing. In exchange for a commitment to a one-year or three-year term, you receive a lower hourly rate.
- **Types**:
  - **Standard RIs**: Offer the most significant discount but are less flexible in terms of instance types.
  - **Convertible RIs**: Offer a lower discount but allow you to change the instance family, OS, and tenancy during the term.
  - **Scheduled RIs**: Allow you to purchase instances that are available to run for specific periods (e.g., a few hours a week).
- **Use Case**: Best for steady-state usage and predictable workloads.

### 3. **Savings Plans**
- **Description**: Savings Plans provide a flexible pricing model offering lower prices on EC2, regardless of instance family, region, or OS, in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one-year or three-year term.
- **Types**:
  - **Compute Savings Plans**: Provide the most flexibility and apply to any EC2 usage.
  - **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**: Apply to usage of a specific instance family in a chosen region.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for predictable usage but with some variability in instance types and regions.

### 4. **Spot Instances**
- **Description**: Spot Instances allow you to bid on unused EC2 capacity at a significantly reduced cost (up to 90% off On-Demand prices). However, they can be terminated by AWS with little notice if the capacity is needed for On-Demand instances.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible applications like batch processing, big data analysis, and testing.

### 5. **Dedicated Hosts**
- **Description**: Dedicated Hosts provide physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. They enable you to use your existing software licenses, including Windows Server, SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for regulatory requirements, licensing requirements, or strong isolation needs.

### 6. **Dedicated Instances**
- **Description**: Dedicated Instances run in a VPC on hardware dedicated to a single customer. They do not provide the same level of isolation as Dedicated Hosts but ensure that instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level.
- **Use Case**: Useful for workloads requiring isolation from other customers‚Äô workloads for compliance or regulatory reasons.

### 7. **Capacity Reservations**
- **Description**: Capacity Reservations ensure that you have reserved capacity for your instances in a specific Availability Zone. They can be used in combination with other purchasing options like On-Demand, RIs, or Savings Plans.
- **Use Case**: Necessary for applications with immediate capacity needs or for disaster recovery scenarios.
