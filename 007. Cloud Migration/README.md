A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software, firmware, or hardware component that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing power. This enables better utilization of physical resources and provides flexibility in managing workloads.
